**💡 LED Blink – Arduino Project**

This project demonstrates the most basic concept in Arduino programming: blinking an LED using digital output pins. It is commonly known as the **"Hello World"** of embedded systems.

The code toggles an LED connected to pin 13 on and off at a fixed interval.

**📌 Features**

1. Turns an LED ON and OFF repeatedly.

2. Uses digital pin 13, which is commonly connected to the onboard LED on most Arduino boards.

3. Demonstrates use of:

  a. pinMode()
  
  b. digitalWrite()
  
  c. delay()
  

**📝 Requirements**

1. Arduino board (Uno/Nano/MEGA/etc.)

2. USB cable

3. Arduino IDE installed

4. Optional: LED + 220Ω resistor (if using external LED)


**▶️ How to Run**

1. Open the .ino file in **Arduino IDE**.

2. Select your board (e.g., Arduino Uno).

3. Select the correct COM port.

4. Click **Upload**.

5. The onboard/external LED will begin blinking **every 0.5 seconds**.



**🔧 Concepts Learned**

1. Digital output

2. Basic timing using delay()

3. Pin configuration

4. Embedded programming fundamentals
